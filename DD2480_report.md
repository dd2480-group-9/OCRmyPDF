# Report for assignment 4

## Project

**Name**: OCRmyPDF

**URL**: [https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF)

OCRmyPDF adds an OCR text layer to scanned PDF files, allowing them to be searched or copy-pasted.

## Onboarding experience

#### Did you choose a new project or continue on the previous one?  
We chose a new project to work on.

#### If you changed the project, how did your experience differ from before?  
We changed projects twice: first to Zulip, and then to the final project, i.e. OCRmyPDF.

For Zulip, the experience was similar, although the setup and onboarding were far more complex due to the need for a virtual machine. These descriptions were not perfect and contained some errors (mostly due to being outdated), at least for Fedora, which made the setup take longer than necessary.

For OCRmyPDF, the onboarding experience was far worse. The complexity of the project and its dependencies is fairly small, making it fairly easy anyway, but some dependencies were not mentioned at all in the contribution guide, and that guide also did not include any instructions on the setup or how to get started.

## Effort spent

For each team member, how much time was spent in each of the categories.

For setting up tools and libraries (step 4), enumerate all dependencies
you took care of and where you spent your time, if that time exceeds
30 minutes.

## Overview of issue(s) and work done.

**Title**: Auto-assign ASN using a barcode label

**URL**: [https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF/issues/959](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF/issues/959)

This issue proposes automatically assigning an Archive Serial Number (ASN) to a document, replacing manual entry and enhancing the connection between physical and archived documents.

The feature integrates into the OCRmyPDF processing pipeline by embedding a barcode (or similar identifier) into the PDF; however, it is designed as a standalone enhancement that should not impact existing code or functionality.

## Requirements for the new feature or requirements affected by functionality being refactored
